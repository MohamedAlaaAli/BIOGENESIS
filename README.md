# BIOGENESIS
This is the project of team BIOGENESIS of CUFE-SBME2025 as a part of our participation in the mathematics research forum
The projct is about breast cancer detection using CNNs using a dataset provided by baheya hosoital
the dataset consists of 3 classes of ultrasound images :
- Normal Breast images
- Benign Breast cancer
- Malignant Breast cancer
each image has 2 types first the image itself ultrasound image and the mask for the cancerous mass
using image augmentation techniques we managed to increase the size of the dataset and make it as balanced as possible in order to prevent the model from biasing
we performed visulalization and exploratory analysis
Then reshaping to make sure the input images are convinient with our model and to reduce the run time for each epoch
